tempLog.py is a program that reads the temperature sensors and pushes them to the sheet every ten minutes. I ran the program for six hours. 

the sheet can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZ2gFq6zwqursdhlRfQFN2ny_H_gO89qKQbeLcEc2R4/edit?usp=sharing.

the credentials is in the credentials.json file. I could only configure it so only my google account would work for this sheet.
